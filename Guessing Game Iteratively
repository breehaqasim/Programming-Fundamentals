#A guessing game between two players requires Player 1 to guess a secret number set by Player 2. If the guess is too low or too high, Player 2 tells Player 1 as such and she can guess again. If Player 1 guesses the secret number in 5 tries, she wins.
#We are going to program the computer to be Player 2 and the user will be Player 1.
#Write an iterative function called guessing_game that takes parameters secret_number and num_tries representing the secret number and the number of Player 1's tries so far. The function should input Player 1's guess, display the corresponding messages, and 
iterate if Player 1 needs to guess again and there are more tries left.

secret_number = int(input())
def guessing_game(secret_number, num_tries):
    while num_tries<6:
      guesses = int(input())
      print("Attempt number",num_tries)
      if guesses==secret_number:
        print("Congratulations, you won! You guessed the secret number",secret_number,"in",num_tries,"guesses.")
        break
      else:
        if num_tries>=5:
           print("Sorry, you lose! Too many wrong guesses.")
        elif guesses>secret_number:
           print("Try again! Your guess is too high.")
        elif guesses<secret_number:
           print("Try again! Your guess is too low.")
      num_tries+=1
      
guessing_game(secret_number,1)
