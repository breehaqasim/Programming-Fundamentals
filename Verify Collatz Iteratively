# Write an iterative function named verify_collatz, which takes an argument n of type int, that prints the sequence of numbers generated by the following algorithm:
#1. Print the number n.
#2. If n is either 1, 5, or 17, stop.
#3. If n is even, divide it by 2; otherwise, triple n and subtract one from it.
#4. Go back to step 1.

def verify_collatz(n):
  while n!=1 and n!=5 and n!=17:
    print(n,end=", ")
    if n%2==0:
      n=int(n/2)
    elif n%2!=0:
      n=int((n*3)-1)
  print(n)
n=int(input())
